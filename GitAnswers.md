1.	What is the difference between git and GitLab?  
    - Git is a version control system, that allows you to save your work and track it,  whereas GitLab is a hosting service that uses Git.
2.	What is the difference between GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket?  
    - GitLab offers a more integrated developers platform, meaning that it can be used for more precise, bigger projects
3.	Why would I ever want to use git, but not GitLab?  
    - You can use Git if your project does not need of cloud collaborators
4.	What are the steps to update the GitLab server with some changes I made on my computer?  
    - You add, commit and push the different files you have changed
5.	What is a branch and why would I use one?  
    - A branch is a subfolder from the main repo, where you can make changes that do not affect the main branch
6.	How could you visualize a branch with 3 commits, and then another branch that breaks off after the second commit and has a single commit?  
    - ---(A)---(B)---(C)---
                   |
                   --(D)---
7.	Give an example of a set of git commands that would result in a merge conflict.  
    - A merge conflict will happen if you edit a file in the main branch and another person edits the same file and tries to merge it
8.	Is Git suitable for latex documents?  
    - Yes, Git supports Latex and it is really useful to keep track of your documents
9.	Should I from now on version my word and powerpoint slides using git? Why/why not?  
    - Yes, so that you can keep track of your changes in just one document instead of having a lot of different versions in different documents
10.	What could happen when I push my latest commit to the remote repository without pulling first?  
    - If there are changes made that you have not pulled, a conflict will arise, as another version of the document is identified by Git
11.	What happens when I pull without commiting my local changes first?  
    - Another conflict may arise if the changes before yours are from the same lines that you also have changed
12.	What is the difference between branching and forking?
    - Branching creates a branch in the current repository, whereas forking makes a copy of the whole repository, including all its branches
